# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a set of instructions. You would use a function in order to run the same information as many times as you'd like without having to rewrite it.

  Researched answer: A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.





2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: .push , .shift , .unshift , .pop , .splice()

  Researched answer: .toString() , .join , .length , .slice() , .reverse 
  


3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: console.log() outputs code into a terminal as where return calls a certaing action.

  Researched answer: Return is a statement that allows a function to output a value back to where it was called. console. log is a function that lets us inspect values for debugging purposes. 



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: An argument is a value that is passed into a function when the function is called. The difference betweena variable and an argument is that a variable can live within or outside of a function; where as an argument would only be called within a function. 

  Researched answer:Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function. JavaScript Variable. Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.





5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques would include both a driver and a navigator. Having the opportunity to be in different roles while programming allows you to view your code in a way that would not be possible if you only played a single role. When being the driver during programming it is your responsibility to decide where you will start. You will type and critically think about how you will accomplish the task at hand. As a navigator you will provide an overview of the code, and provide a second- outside perspective to what else could have been done.  

  Researched answer:pair programming is where two developers work using only one machine. Each one has a keyboard and a mouse. One programmer acts as the driver who codes while the other will serve as the observer who will check the code being written, proofread and spell check it, while also figuring out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa.



6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer:
Javascript gives functionality to everyday websites, apps, and systems. It is what allows us to interact with our programs and gives our programs the ability to give us more dynamic options.

7. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I found the challenges very helpful as it allowed us to put into real practice the knowledge gained from the lectures presented.
